### Set up project with Create-React-App

**Create-React-App** is a command-line interface tool. In terminal, navigate to the directory and use the command (`create-react-app@5` to use version 5 of the tool):

```cmd
npm create-react-app Your-App-Name
```

The create-react-app will download and create some files inside the project directory. It seems a regular npm project create by `npm init` command which includes the standrd files like `package.json` or `node_modules` directory.

The main folder for the development is `src`. The `public` folder contains all the assets that will end up in the final application like images, favicon, index.html file.
