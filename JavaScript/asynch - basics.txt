// ASYNCHRONOUS JS - BASICS //
//////////////////////////////


/*  ----- Synchronous:
 -  is executed line by line
 -  each line of code is waiting for previous line to finish
 -  it's blocking code (like alert) are blocking the code
 -  callbacks alone and eventListeners alone are not making code asynchronous
 -  setTimeout + callback make code asynchronous */


/* ----- Asynchronous:
 -  means not working in a linear timeline
 -  it's not blocking code, so execution move to the next line without waiting the code */


/* ----- AJAX calls:
 -  probably the most important use case of asynchronous JS.
 -  means: Asynchronous JavaScript And XML
 -  allows us to communicate with remote web servers in an asynchronous way.
    Thanks to AJAX calls you can request data from web servers dynamically,
    and dynamically means without reloading the page.
 -  wih AJAX a client (browser) can make HTTP request from server.
    then server can make a response with requested data.
    This all happens asynchronously
 -  there are different methods to make request (GET to recieve, POST to send)
 -  usually when you request data from the server, server has API which contains data */


/* ----- API:
 -  Application Programming Interface
 -  it's a piece of software that can be used by another piece of software to
    allow applications comunicate with each other.
 -  there are a lot of API like DOM, Geolocation, LoacalStorage etc and online API
 -  Online API (web API): 
    application running on a server, that receives requests for data and sends data back as a response.
 -  XML is a data format used in the past but not used anymore today byt APIs.
 -  people call AJAX even if they don't use XML (they're used to), but todate they use JSON
 -  most APIs use JSON format: JavaScript Object Notation (object converted to a string) */


/* ----- Public APIs:
 -	https://github.com/public-apis
 -	Auth: need or not authentication
 -	HTTPS: good one
 -	CORS: Cross Origin Resource Sharing and should be yes or Unknown 
 	without CORS, we cannot access a third party API 
 -	You need API Enpoint which is the URL of API which you can use */
