# Guide to Update Nvidia Drivers on Kubuntu

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to update Nvidia drivers on Kubuntu.

## Step 1: Add the Graphics Drivers PPA

Open a terminal and run the following commands to add the Graphics Drivers PPA (Personal Package Archive):

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
sudo apt update
```

## Step 2: Identify the Recommended Driver

Use the `ubuntu-drivers` command to identify the recommended driver for your GPU:

```bash
ubuntu-drivers devices
```

You should see an output listing available drivers for your Nvidia GPU. Look for the recommended driver in the list. For example, the output may look something like this:

```bash
== /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0 ==
modalias : pci:v000010DEd00002489sv00001043sd00008850bc03sc00i00
vendor   : NVIDIA Corporation
model    : GA104 [GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Lite Hash Rate]
driver   : nvidia-driver-535-server - distro non-free
driver   : nvidia-driver-535-open - distro non-free
driver   : nvidia-driver-545-open - third-party non-free
driver   : nvidia-driver-535-server-open - distro non-free
driver   : nvidia-driver-470-server - distro non-free
driver   : nvidia-driver-470 - distro non-free
driver   : nvidia-driver-535 - distro non-free
driver   : nvidia-driver-545 - third-party non-free recommended
driver   : xserver-xorg-video-nouveau - distro free builtin
```

## Step 3: Install the Recommended Driver

Install the recommended driver using `apt`. For example, if the recommended driver is `nvidia-driver-545`, run:

```bash
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-545
```

## Step 4: Reboot Your System

After the installation is complete, reboot your system to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

## Step 5: Verify the Installation

After rebooting, open the terminal and run:

```bash
nvidia-settings
```

This command should launch the Nvidia X Server Settings application. If it opens successfully, your Nvidia driver installation is complete.

## Step 6: Set Primary Monitor (Optional)

To set the primary monitor using the Nvidia X Server Settings:

1. Open Nvidia X Server Settings (`nvidia-settings`).
2. Go to "X Server Display Configuration".
3. Select your primary monitor.
4. Check the option "Make this the primary display".
5. Apply and save the configuration.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, you can try the following:

1. **Reinstall the Driver**: If the driver did not install correctly, you can remove and reinstall it.
   ```bash
   sudo apt remove --purge '^nvidia-.*'
   sudo apt install nvidia-driver-545
   sudo reboot
   ```

2. **Check for Additional Dependencies**: Sometimes additional packages are required.
   ```bash
   sudo apt install nvidia-settings nvidia-prime
   ```

3. **Check Logs for Errors**: Review system logs for any errors related to Nvidia drivers.
   ```bash
   dmesg | grep -i nvidia
   ```
