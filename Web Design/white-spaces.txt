// Web Design: white-spaces //
//////////////////////////////


// ----- General rules ----- //

 -  the right amount of whitespace makes designs look clean, modern and polished
 -  whitespaces communicates how different pieces of information are related to one another
 -  whitespaces creates invisible relationships between the elements


// ----- How to use it ----- //

 -  use tons of whitespace between sections
 -  use it between groups of elements
 -  use it between elements
 -  the more elements belong together, the closer they should stay and vice versa
    (it's called "the law of proximity")
 -  start with a lot of white space, then remove whitespace from there is best solution
 -  match white space with other elements, if you have big icons and images,
    then you also need big white spaces
 -  general rule is to have some smaller size and multiplier of text size
    e.g. 16px like: 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 128 ...
