// Web Design: shadows //
/////////////////////////


// ----- General rules ----- //

 -  you don't have to use shadows, use them only if they makes sense for the personality of the Website
 -  more serious/elegant website is, less shadows we use
 -  more playful/fun website is, more shadows we use
 -  use shadows in small doses, don't add shadow to every element
 -  go light on shadows, don't make them too dark (shadows should seems natural)


// ----- How Using ----- //

 -  use small-size shadows for smaller elements that should stand out (like forms, buttons)
 -  use medium-size shadows for larger areas that should stand out a bit more (entire sections, cards)
 -  use large-size shadows for elements that should really float aboce the interface (like pop-ups, navigations)
 -  experiment with changing shadows on mouse interaction (click, hover)
 -  experiment with glows (colored shadows)


// ----- CSS Properties ----- //

- box-shadow: horizonatal, vertical, blur, scale (optional), color
- text-shadow: horizonatal, vertical, blur, color
