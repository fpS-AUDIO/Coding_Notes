Typography:
    is the art and technique of arranging type to make written
    language legible, readable and appealing when displayed.


Typefaces:
 1. serif: 
    font with small details like tails (serif) at the end of letter lines
    for classic/tradtional look and feel and good for long text

 2. sans-serif: 
    font without serif (decorastive lines in the boder of letters)
    for modern and clean look, easier to choose for beginners



// ----- Rules ----- //

-   use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe
    serif examples: merriweather, aleo, playfair dosplay, cormorant, cardo, lora
    sans-serif examples: inter, open sans, roboto, montserrat, work sans, lato
-   it's okey to use just one typeface per page (max 2)
-   choose the right typeface for personality
-   when choosingg font-size, limit chooices using "type-scale" tool.
    normal: 16-32px
    long-text: 20px+
    heding: 50Px+ and bold (600+) depending on personality
    never use font weight under 400
-   use less then 75 character per line (should be 65-75)
-   for normal-sized text use line-height 1.5-2, for big below 1.5
    (smaller or longer text, the larger line height should be)
-   if headline looks unnatural descrease letter spacing
-   experiment with all caps for short titles, make them small and bold and
    increase letter-spacing
-   usually, don't justify text or align it to center
