/**
 * Regenerator-Runtime Documentation Notes
 * ----------------------------------------
 *
 * Overview:
 * Regenerator-runtime is a runtime library for Regenerator-compiled generator and async functions.
 * It's often used in conjunction with Babel to compile ES2015+ code down to ES5, making it possible to
 * use async/await and generator functions in environments that do not natively support these features.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Enables the use of async/await and generator functions in older browsers or environments.
 * - Works seamlessly with Babel and other transpilers that convert ES2015+ code to ES5.
 *
 * Installation:
 * npm install regenerator-runtime
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * // Import regenerator-runtime at the entry point of your application
 * import 'regenerator-runtime/runtime';
 *
 * // This allows you to use async/await and generator functions in your code
 * async function fetchData() {
 *   const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
 *   const data = await response.json();
 *   return data;
 * }
 *
 * Best Practices:
 * - Include regenerator-runtime in the main entry file of your application to ensure it's loaded before any other code.
 * - Use in projects where you need to support older browsers that do not have native async/await or generator function support.
 *
 * Integration with Babel:
 * When using Babel, ensure you have the necessary presets and plugins configured to transpile async/await and generator functions.
 * Regenerator-runtime is often used in combination with @babel/preset-env.
 *
 * Example .babelrc configuration:
 * {
 *   "presets": [
 *     ["@babel/preset-env", {
 *       "targets": "> 0.25%, not dead",
 *       "useBuiltIns": "entry",
 *       "corejs": 3
 *     }]
 *   ]
 * }
 *
 * Note: "useBuiltIns": "entry" with "corejs": 3 ensures that Babel will include polyfills for missing features based on the specified browser targets.
