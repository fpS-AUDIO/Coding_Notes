<div> (Division)

    - A block-level element used to group together HTML elements and apply CSS styling or JavaScript functionality.
    - Represents a generic container with no semantic meaning.
    - By default, it occupies the full width available and starts on a new line.

Example:

<div class="groupone">
    <!-- Other elements here -->
    <p>Paragraph inside a div.</p>
</div>



<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- --> 
<span>

    - An inline element used for grouping a small section of HTML elements, often for styling purposes.
    - Does not cause a line break and takes up only as much width as necessary.
    - Useful for styling a part of a text, or for applying CSS to a small segment without affecting the entire block.

Example:

<p>This is a paragraph with <span class="highlight">highlighted text</span>.</p>

Best Practices:

    - Use <div> for grouping larger blocks of code and creating layout structures.
    - Use <span> for smaller, inline elements, especially within texts.
    - Avoid overusing <div> tags, known as 'divitis'. 
        Use semantic HTML5 elements (<header>, <footer>, <article>, etc.) where appropriate for better readability and SEO.
    - Keep the class and id names descriptive for maintainability.
