<!--    Overview of Semantic HTML Elements:

  1. Purpose of Semantic HTML:
     - Semantic HTML elements provide meaningful information about the content they enclose, improving accessibility and SEO.
     - They help in structuring the webpage content in a logically organized way.

  2. Core Semantic Elements:
     - <!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type and HTML version.
     - <html>: The root element of an HTML page.
     - <head>: Contains meta-information about the document, like <title>, <meta> tags, link to CSS, etc.
     - <body>: Contains the content of the HTML document.
       - <header>: Typically contains introductory content or navigational links.
       - <nav>: Navigation bar, often includes <ul> for unordered lists of navigation links.
       - <main>: Represents the primary content of the body, unique to the document.
       - <article>: For self-contained, independent content, often used in blogs or news sites.
       - <section>: Defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.
       - <aside>: Used for content tangentially related to the content around the <aside> element, often as sidebars.
       - <footer>: Represents footer content, typically containing information about the author, copyright data, or related links.
       - <span>: An inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
       - <div>: A block-level container used to group together HTML elements and format them with CSS.

  3. Other Structural Elements:
     - <br>: Line break, used to break the line of text.
     - <hr>: Thematic break, visually represented as a horizontal line.

  4. Best Practices:
     - Use semantic elements to improve accessibility and SEO.
     - Avoid using <div> and <span> for everything; use them when no other semantic element is appropriate.
     - Structure the HTML document in a logical flow for ease of reading and accessibility. -->
