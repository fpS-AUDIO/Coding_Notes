// --- About ---


The Cmap software is a versatile, free tool designed to facilitate the creation 
of Concept Maps, which visually represent relationships between concepts and ideas. 
Although primarily used for educational purposes and knowledge sharing, 
its functionality can be extended to planning projects, including software development 
and creating flowcharts. Cmap allows users to construct, navigate, share, 
and critically discuss models of their thought processes and ideas. 
Its intuitive interface supports drag-and-drop elements, making it easy to organize 
and link concepts with labeled arrows, enabling a clear visual representation of any 
project's flow or structure.

// --- For Web Development ---


For web project planning, Cmap can be particularly useful in outlining 
the architecture of a website, planning user interaction flows, 
or detailing the relationships between various components of the project. 
The ability to collaboratively work on maps in real-time and share them 
online makes Cmap an excellent tool for teams.
