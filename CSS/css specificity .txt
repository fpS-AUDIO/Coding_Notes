--- CSS SPECIFICITY ---


Specificity in CSS establishes the hierarchy of styles, determining which styles take precedence over others.

Tag Selector (Element):
    We can specify styles for a group of tags, such as <li> list elements.
    Specified style points: 1 point.

Class Selector:
    Styles applied to a class (.class) will override those of the tag selector.
    Specified style points: 10 points.

ID Selector:
    Styles applied to an ID (#id) will override those of a class selector.
    Specified style points: 100 points.

Inline Style:
    Overrides the styles of the preceding selectors.
    Specified style points: 1000 points.

!important:
    Overrides all other styles.
    Specified style points: Infinite (highest precedence).
