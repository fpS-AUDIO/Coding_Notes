/* --- MEDIA QUERY --- */


/*  Base Concepts:
    Media queries allow for responsive design by applying different styles based on device characteristics. */


/*  There are 4 types of media queries:
        1.  all         ->  For all media types, default if none is specified.
        2.  print       ->  Specifically for print mode (Ctrl + P).
        3.  screen      ->  For screens (computers, tablets, phones).
        4.  speech      ->  For screenreaders and assistive devices. */


/* EXAMPLE */

@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
        color: blue;
    }
}
/* Explanation:
   This changes the body color to blue only in screen mode (not for print)
   and only for screen widths below 600px.

   Other adjustable media features include:
    -   max-width
    -   max-height
    -   min-width
    -   min-height
    -   aspect-ratio
    -   resolution
    -   color
*/




/* ------------------------- Screen Size and Device Type */


@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    /* Styles for screens smaller than 600px width */
}

@media print {
    /* Styles specifically for print mode */
}







/* ------------------------- Orientation */


/*  Orientation Options:
    -   landscape: Width greater than height.
    -   portrait: Width less than height. */

@media (orientation: landscape) {
    /* Styles for landscape orientation */
}

@media (orientation: portrait) {
    /* Styles for portrait orientation */
}




/* ------------------------- High Resolution / Retina Displays */


@media only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2), 
       only screen and (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio: 2), 
       only screen and (-o-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2/1), 
       only screen and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2), 
       only screen and (min-resolution: 192dpi), 
       only screen and (min-resolution: 2dppx) {
    /* Styles for high DPI screens */
}




/* ------------------------- Dark Mode */


@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    /* Styles for users who prefer dark mode */
}





/* ------------------------- Reduced Motion (Accessibility) */


@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
    /* Styles for users who prefer reduced motion */
}





/* ------------------------- Logical Operators */


@media (max-width: 1220px) and (orientation: landscape) {
    /* Styles when both conditions are met: max-width 1220px and landscape orientation */
}

/* Using 'not', 'and', and 'or' */

/*  Logical Operators:
    1.  and -> Both conditions must be true.
           @media (max-width: 1220px) and (orientation: landscape) {...}

    2.  or  -> At least one of the conditions must be true.
           @media (max-width: 1220px), (orientation: landscape) {...}

    3.  not -> Negates the specified conditions.
           @media not screen and (orientation: portrait) {
               body {
                   background-color: white;  /* White background everywhere but not on portrait screens */
               }
           }
*/

@media not all and (monochrome) {
    /* Styles for screens that are not monochrome */
}




/* ------------------------- Pointing (cursor) and not devices */


@media (hover: hover) {
    body {
        background-color: blue;
    }
}

@media (pointer: coarse) {
    /* CSS rules here will apply to devices with a coarse pointing mechanism, typically touch screens. */
}






/*  NOTE: */
/*  For choosing breakpoints in responsive design, it's best to focus on content breakpoints rather than specific device sizes. 
    Design for content breakpoints, adding them where your content naturally breaks. 
    Minimizing breakpoints and using flexible layouts with grid and flexbox can create more fluid and adaptable designs. */
