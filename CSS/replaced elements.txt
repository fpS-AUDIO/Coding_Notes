/*  Replaced elements, like images and embedded media, have content outside the CSS rendering model. 
    They usually have intrinsic dimensions and can be affected by CSS properties for size, spacing, and content rendering. 
    
    Altering the dimensions and aspect ratio of these elements is possible.
    While maintaining the original aspect ratio is usually preferred for visual consistency, 
    adjusting it might be necessary in certain designs. */

    /* Other object-fit values: 
        - fill: The replaced content is sized to fill the element's content box, possibly stretching the content.
        - cover: The content is sized to maintain its aspect ratio while filling the element's entire content box. The content is clipped to fit.
        - none: The content is rendered at its natural size.
        - scale-down: The content is sized as if 'none' or 'contain' were specified, whichever would result in a smaller concrete object size. */

    /* object-position: Specifies the alignment of the replaced element inside its box (e.g., 'center', 'top left'). */
