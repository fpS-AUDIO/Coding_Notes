# Styling Buttons in Tailwind CSS

## Introduction

Styling buttons is a common requirement in web development. Tailwind CSS offers a powerful and flexible set of utilities to style buttons, handle their states, and apply transitions.

## Theory

### Basic Button Styling

Tailwind provides various utilities to style buttons, including setting padding, background color, text color, border radius, and more.

```html
<button class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded">Button</button>
```

### Button States

Handling different states such as hover, focus, active, and disabled is crucial for enhancing user experience.

#### Hover State

Use the `hover:` prefix to apply styles when the button is hovered over.

```html
<button class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-700">
  Hover Me
</button>
```

#### Focus State

Use the `focus:` prefix to apply styles when the button is focused.

```html
<button
  class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-300"
>
  Focus Me
</button>
```

#### Active State

Use the `active:` prefix to apply styles when the button is actively being clicked.

```html
<button class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded active:bg-blue-800">
  Active Me
</button>
```

#### Disabled State

Use the `disabled:` prefix to apply styles when the button is disabled. Combine it with the `disabled` attribute in HTML.

```html
<button
  class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded disabled:opacity-50"
  disabled
>
  Disabled
</button>
```

### Transitions

Transitions improve the user interface by providing smooth changes between states. Use the `transition` utility to enable transitions and control their properties.

#### Basic Transition

Enable a transition with default properties.

```html
<button
  class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded transition duration-300 ease-in-out transform hover:bg-blue-700"
>
  Transition
</button>
```

#### Custom Transition

Customize the transition duration, timing function, and the properties it applies to.

```html
<button
  class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded transition-all duration-500 ease-in-out transform hover:bg-blue-700 hover:scale-110"
>
  Custom Transition
</button>
```

## Common Patterns

### Primary and Secondary Buttons

Create a consistent style for primary and secondary buttons.

```html
<button
  class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-300"
>
  Primary
</button>
<button
  class="px-4 py-2 bg-gray-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-gray-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-gray-300"
>
  Secondary
</button>
```

### Icon Buttons

Style buttons that contain icons.

```html
<button
  class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded flex items-center space-x-2 hover:bg-blue-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-300"
>
  <svg class="w-4 h-4" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
    <path
      stroke-linecap="round"
      stroke-linejoin="round"
      stroke-width="2"
      d="M5 13l4 4L19 7"
    />
  </svg>
  <span>Icon Button</span>
</button>
```

### Full-Width Buttons

Make buttons expand to the full width of their container.

```html
<button
  class="w-full px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-300"
>
  Full Width
</button>
```

### Grouped Buttons

Style a group of buttons with proper spacing and alignment.

```html
<div class="flex space-x-2">
  <button
    class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-300"
  >
    Button 1
  </button>
  <button
    class="px-4 py-2 bg-gray-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-gray-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-gray-300"
  >
    Button 2
  </button>
  <button
    class="px-4 py-2 bg-green-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-green-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-green-300"
  >
    Button 3
  </button>
</div>
```
